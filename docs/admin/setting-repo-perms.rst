Repository Administration
=========================

Repository permissions in |RCE| can be managed in a number of different ways.
This overview should give you an insight into how you could adopt particular
settings for your needs:

* Global |repo| permissions: This allows you to set the default permissions
  for each new |repo| created within |RCE|, see :ref:`repo-default-ref`. All
  |repos| created will inherit these permissions unless explicitly configured.
* Individual |repo| permissions: To set individual |repo| permissions,
  see :ref:`set-repo-perms`.
* Repository Group permissions: This allows you to define the permissions for
  a group, and all |repos| created within that group will inherit the same
  permissions.
