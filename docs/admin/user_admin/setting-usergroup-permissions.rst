Setting User Group Permissions
------------------------------

To set User Group |repo| permissions, use follow these steps:

1. From the |RCE| interface, select
   :menuselection:`Admin --> User Group --> Add User Group`
2. Enter a group name and description, and select :guilabel:`Save`
3. Select :guilabel:`edit` beside the new User Group. On the following
   screen you will see a number of tabs. Exploring these
   you will find the following most used options:

* :guilabel:`Owner`: This allows you to change the User Group owner. As
  super-admin you will still have access to this, but changing the owner lets
  you delegate the user group management to another manager.
* :guilabel:`Members`: This allows you to added or remove users from the
  group.
* :guilabel:`User Permissions`: On the permissions tab you can set the
  permissions for each member. If not individually set, the members will
  inherit the default user permissions.
* :guilabel:`Inherit from default settings`: On the Global Permissions tab
  you can uncheck this option and explicitly configure the permissions for
  the group.
