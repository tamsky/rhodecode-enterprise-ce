|RCE| Repository Hooks
======================

|RCE| installs hooks inside each of the |repos| that it manages. These
hooks enable users to execute custom actions based on certain events.
This is the complete list of |repos| hooks and the events which trigger them:

    \--CREATE_REPO_GROUP_HOOK
        Any time a |repo| group is created.

    \--CREATE_USER_HOOK
        Any time a user is created.

    \--DELETE_REPO_HOOK
        Any time a |repo| is created.

    \--DELETE_USER_HOOK
        Any time a user is deleted.

    \--PRE_CREATE_USER_HOOK
        Any time a user is created but before the action is executed by |RCE|.

    \--PRE_PULL
        Any pull from a |repo| but before the action is executed by |RCE|.

    \--PRE_PUSH
        Any push to a |repo| but before the action is executed by |RCE|.

    \--POST_PUSH
        After any push to a |repo|.

        Commits via API actions that update references are also counted.
