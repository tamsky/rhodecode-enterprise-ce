Default User Permissions
------------------------

There are two ways in which the default user settings work:

System-wide Level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a system-wide level, you can set the default user permissions so that
all new users are given a certain set of permissions unless individually
tailored, or added to a user group. For more information about system-wide
default permissions, see the :ref:`permissions-info-anon-ref` and
:ref:`permissions-default-ref` sections.

User Group Level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a user group level, you can set the default user settings for the user
group, and all users within that group will get those default permissions
unless individually tailored. For more information about setting default
permissions for all the different entities, see the
:ref:`permissions-default-ref` section.

For more detailed information about managing the different permissions
settings, see the following sections:
