Ticket Checklists
=================


Ticket Description
==================

In general these things really matter in the description:

- Reasoning / Rationale. Explain "WHY" it makes sense and is important.

- How to reproduce. Easy to follow steps, thatâ€™s important.

  - Observation: The problem (short)

  - Expectation: How it should be (short)

- Specs: It is fine to draft them as good as it works.

  If anything is unclear, please ask for a review or help on this via the
  Community Portal or Slack channel.

Hints

Change Description
------------------

It can be tricky to figure out how to change the description of a ticket. There
is a very small pencil which has to be clicked once you see the edit form of a
ticket.
