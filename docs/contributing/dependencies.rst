 Dependency management
=======================


Overview
========

We use the Nix package manager to handle our dependencies. In general we use the
packages out of the package collection `nixpkgs`. For frequently changing
dependencies for Python and JavaScript we use the tools which are described in
this section to generate the needed Nix derivations.


Please check pkgs/README.rst file for mor information on how to build the packages.
