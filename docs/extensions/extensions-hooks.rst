Extensions & Hooks
==================

The extensions & hooks section references three concepts regularly,
so to clarify what is meant each time, read the following definitions:

* **Plugin**: A Plugin is software that adds a specific feature to
  an existing software application.
* **Extension**: An extension extends the capabilities of,
  or the data available to, an existing software application.
* **Hook**: A hook intercepts function calls, messages, or events passed
  between software components and can be used to trigger plugins, or their
  extensions.
