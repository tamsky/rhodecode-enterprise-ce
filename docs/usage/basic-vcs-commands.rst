Getting Started with VCS
------------------------

When using |RCM|, you will be working with |git| or |hg| |repos| from the
command line.

If you have never used either before, the following information should
help you set up your local machine so that you can sync changes with the
|RCM| server.

All of the following instructions assume you have a |RCM| account,
and you can access your |repos| from the web interface.

.. note::

   |svn| |repo| management is currently only available from the web interface.
