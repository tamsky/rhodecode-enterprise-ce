LDAP
----

|RCM| supports LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or
AD (active Directory) authentication.
All LDAP versions are supported, with the following |RCM| plugins managing each:

* For LDAPv3 use ``LDAP (egg:rhodecode-enterprise-ce#ldap)``
* For LDAPv3 with user group sync use ``LDAP + User Groups (egg:rhodecode-enterprise-ee#ldap_group)``


.. important::

   The email used with your |RCE| super-admin account needs to match the email
   address attached to your admin profile in LDAP. This is because
   within |RCE| the user email needs to be unique, and multiple users
   cannot share an email account.

   Likewise, if as an admin you also have a user account, the email address
   attached to the user account needs to be different.

LDAP Configuration Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure |LDAP|, use the following steps:

1. From the |RCM| interface, select
   :menuselection:`Admin --> Authentication`
2. Enable the required plugin and select :guilabel:`Save`
3. Select the :guilabel:`Enabled` check box in the plugin configuration section
4. Add the required LDAP information and :guilabel:`Save`, for more details,
   see :ref:`config-ldap-examples`

For a more detailed description of LDAP objects, see :ref:`ldap-gloss-ref`:
