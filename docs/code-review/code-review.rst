Code Review
===========

|RCM| provides two ways in which you can review code. You can review |prs| or
commits. To better understand |prs|, see the :ref:`pull-requests-ref`
and :ref:`collaborate-ref` sections. For more information about why
code review matters, see these posts on the topic:

* `Code Review - Fix Bugs Early and Often`_
* `Code Review - How to Convince a Skeptic`_
* `Code Review - Learn How NASA Codes`_

You can also use the |RCE| API set up continuous integration servers to leave
comments from a test suite. See the :ref:`api` and
:ref:`integrations-ref` sections for examples on how to set this up.
