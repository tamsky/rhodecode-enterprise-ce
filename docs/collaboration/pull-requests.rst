Pull Requests
=============

Once a |pr| is open, you can use a variety of different code review functions
to ensure the quality or style of code is appropriate for your standards. The
|pr| is then merged with the main branch when it is approved. The following
steps are an overview of the workflow:

1. Create a fork or branch of a |repo|.
2. Complete your works and open a pull request.
3. Notify users to review and approve the |pr|.
4. Merge the code to the target |repo|.
