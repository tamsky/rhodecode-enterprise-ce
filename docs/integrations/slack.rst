Slack integration
=================

To set a Slack integration up it is first necessary to set up a Slack webhook api
endpoint for your slack channel, this can be done at:

https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/

Once you have set up a Slack webhook integrations url of the
form: ``https://hooks.slack.com/services/...``, create a ``slack`` integration
in :ref:`creating-integrations`.
