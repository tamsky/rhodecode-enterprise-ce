Webhook integration
===================

The Webhook integration allows you to POST events such as repository pushes
or pull requests to a custom http endpoint as a json dict with details of the
event.

To create a webhook integration, select "webhook" in the integration settings
and use the url and key from your custom webhook. See
:ref:`creating-integrations` for additional instructions.
