Single source for redirection links.

Goal of this module is to provide a single source of truth regarding external
links. The data inside this module is used to configure the routing
system of Enterprise and it is used also as a base to check if this data
and our server configuration are in sync.

.. py:data:: link_config

   Contains the configuration for external links. Each item is supposed to be
   a `dict` like this example::

      {"name": "url_name",
       "target": "https://rhodecode.com/r1/enterprise/keyword/",
       "external_target": "https://example.com/some-page.html",
      }

then you can retrieve the url by simply calling the URL function:

`h.url('url_name')`

The redirection must be first implemented in our servers before
you can see it working.
