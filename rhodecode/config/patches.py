Compatibility patches.

Please keep the following principles in mind:

* Keep imports local, so that importing this module does not cause too many
  side effects by itself.

* Try to make patches idempotent, calling them multiple times should not do
  harm. If that is not possible, ensure that the second call explodes.

    Kombu 1.5.1 relies on a private method which got removed in Python 2.7.11.

    This patch adds the symbol to the module :mod:`uuid` and assigns the value
    ``None`` to it. This causes kombu to fall back to the public API of
    :mod:`uuid`.

    This patch can most probably be removed once celery and kombu are updated
    to more recent versions.
